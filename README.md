# Apple iPhone Sales Analysis Project Report

## Introduction
The Apple iPhone Sales Analysis Project aims to analyze the sales data of various iPhone models in India. The project utilizes Python programming language along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, and plotly to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and visualize the insights gained from the analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is named "apple_products.csv". It consists of information about different iPhone models, including their names, sale prices, discounts, ratings, reviews, and other relevant details. The data was sourced from Flipkart, a popular e-commerce platform in India.

## Data Cleaning
Before conducting any analysis, the dataset underwent a cleaning process to handle missing values and ensure data consistency. No missing values were found in the dataset, indicating its reliability for further analysis.

## Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics were calculated to gain insights into the central tendency and distribution of key variables such as sale price, discount percentage, number of ratings, number of reviews, star rating, etc. These statistics provided a summary of the dataset, aiding in understanding the overall trends and patterns.

## Top 10 iPhone Sales in India
One of the primary objectives of the analysis was to identify the top-selling iPhone models in India based on their star ratings. The top 10 iPhone models with the highest star ratings were determined and presented, showcasing the preferences of Indian consumers towards specific iPhone variants.

## Highest Rated iPhone Visualization
A bar chart was created to visually represent the distribution of the highest-rated iPhone models based on the number of ratings they received. This visualization provides a clear overview of which iPhone models garnered the most positive feedback from consumers.

## Highest Reviewed iPhone Visualization
Similarly, another bar chart was generated to illustrate the distribution of the highest-reviewed iPhone models based on the number of reviews they received. This visualization helps in understanding which iPhone models attracted the most attention and engagement from consumers.

## Sale Price vs Number of Ratings
A scatter plot was constructed to analyze the relationship between the sale price of iPhone models and the number of ratings they received. This visualization aims to identify any patterns or trends regarding consumer behavior concerning pricing and product feedback.

## Number of Ratings vs Discount Percentage
Another scatter plot was created to investigate the relationship between the number of ratings received by iPhone models and the discount percentage offered on their sale prices. This visualization aids in understanding how discounts may influence consumer engagement and product ratings.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Apple iPhone Sales Analysis Project provides valuable insights into the sales performance and consumer preferences regarding iPhone models in India. The analysis sheds light on the top-selling, highest-rated, and most-reviewed iPhone variants, as well as the relationships between pricing, discounts, and consumer feedback. This project serves as a useful resource for understanding market trends and making data-driven decisions in the context of iPhone sales in India.
